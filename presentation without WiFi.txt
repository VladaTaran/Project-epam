Lemony Cream Cheese Pancakes with Blueberries

1 1/2 cups flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1	tablespoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 
1 pinch salt, 2 large eggs, 1 cup buttermilk

In a medium bowl, mix together flour, sugar baking powder, baking soda, salt. 
In a separate bowl, whisk together egg yolks, buttermilk. Add cream cheese and mix until cream cheese 
has separated into uniformly small lumps, about the size of large cottage cheese curds. Stir in melted butter, vanilla, lemon 
juice and lemon zest. Add dry ingredients to wet, then stir to combine. Whisk two egg whites until stiff but 
not dry; fold gently into batter.

White Olive Cookies

1/4 cup sugar plus more for coating, 
2 tablespoons grated or microplaned orange zest (preferably organic), 
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 
1/2	cup oil-cured black olives pitted and chopped (about 1/3 cup chopped), 
1/4	teaspoon baking powder

Position a rack in the upper half of the oven. Preheat to 375° F. If you have two silicone mats, get them ready! 
If not, cut two sheets of parchment to fit a sheet pan. (You'll bake the cookies 1 sheet pan at a time.) 
Combine the sugar and orange zest in a bowl. Pinch together with your fingertips until the sugar begins to blush 
(this intensifies the citrusy flavor). Add the flour, olives, baking powder, and salt. Stir with a fork until 
everything is evenly distributed. Add the egg to the measuring cup with the olive oil and beat with a fork until 
smooth. Add to the dry ingredients and stir first with a fork, then your hands until a dough forms—no dry spots, 
holds together when squeezed.

Winter salad

2 cups chopped, stemmed curly kale, 
1 cup shredded red cabbage, 
1 cup peeled cubed (about 1/2-inch) red beets (raw!), 
3/4	cup cooked or canned rinsed chickpeas, 
1/4	cup pickled red onions, 
1/4	cup fresh cilantro leaves, 
1/4	cup crumbled feta

Pickle the red onion. Combine the vinegar, water, salt, and sugar in a bowl and stir until the salt and sugar 
dissolve. You could heat the water and vinegar first, or not. Add the onions and toss. Let stand for at least 
30 minutes, tossing now and again. If you’re not using them right away, store in the refrigerator. Combine the 
kale, cabbage, beets, chickpeas, pickled onions, cilantro, feta, and pepitas in a big bowl. Dress with oil, 
vinegar, and salt to taste. Top with avocado.

Christmas Recipes

2 Delicata squash, 
Salt, 
Olive oil, 
1 lime

Slice the ends off of the squash. Slice into 1/2" rings and remove the seeds with a spoon. Reserve the seeds for 
another use or roast them with some cayenne pepper, salt, and cumin and sprinkle over the finished dish. 
Lightly salt the squash and let sit for 30 minutes. Completely dry off with paper towels, removing the salt. 
Heat enough oil to coat a saute pan over medium high heat. Lightly salt the squash rings with fresh salt and add 
them to the pan. They should sizzle the moment they hit the pan. Don't crowd them or they'll steam more than 
they'll brown. Sauté until lightly browned (about 2 minutes per side).
